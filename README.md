# Friendlyballgame
Old school brick and ball game that is my first coding ever done...aka currently a little bit of a buggy mess
Based off of a tutorial from youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCqOnchV4V0&t=4867s by Imphenzia
Plan was to try and add multipleballs at once, fix physics engine and weirdness that happens. Improve the UI and just figure out coding along the way. Maybe change the controls
to arrow keys instead of mouse and limit the speed that the player can move at or keep it the same all that time. 
Basically use the tutorial base but add mroe to it as a first project
